# Predicting Life Expectancy using Machine Learning
Lifez Prediction

# Project Summary:
 This project aims to predict the lifespan of a human being, based on various factors such
as Regional variations, Economic Circumstances, Mental Illnesses, Physical Illnesses, Eduaction,
Year of their birth and other demographic factors which is in a dataset that was collected by
WHO and United Nations website. This project finds the expected solution using various
machine learning algorithms such as: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, SVM, Clustering,
and Polynomic Regression. Using these ML Algorithms, we have to find the relationship of the
various factors with the lifespan of an individual. 

The dataset used for the prediction contains data from year 2000 to 2015. It contains more than
2500 entries and around 22 columns with various features like Population, Status, Alcohol, Infant
Deaths etc., which aids the prediction of the model.
